# Healthcare Appointment Platform

A patient-centric healthcare appointment prototype: discover doctors, check live
availability, book / reschedule / cancel appointments, and track status — with
AI-assisted recommendations, provider scheduling tools, and an admin analytics
dashboard.

Built as a **working prototype** (React + Express, in-memory datastore), no
external services or API keys required.

---

## Quick start

Two terminals, from the project root.

```bash
# 1) API server  -> http://localhost:5000
cd server
npm install
npm run dev

# 2) Web client  -> http://localhost:5173
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**.

Verify the API end-to-end (with the server running):

```bash
cd server
node scripts/smoke.js     # 35 assertions across auth, discovery, booking, AI, admin
```

> The datastore persists to `server/.data/db.json`. Delete that file to reset to
> a fresh seed.

## Demo accounts

| Role    | Email                                    | Password     |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Patient | `patient@demo.com`                       | `patient123` |
| Patient | `ishita@demo.com`                        | `patient123` |
| Patient | `aman@demo.com`                          | `patient123` |
| Doctor  | `doctor1@demo.com` … `doctor12@demo.com` | `doctor123`  |
| Admin   | `admin@demo.com`                         | `admin123`   |

Sign in as each role to see the role-specific dashboards.

## Tech stack

**Client** — React 18, React Router 6, Vite 5. No UI framework; styling is a
hand-written design system in `client/src/styles/index.css`.

**Server** — Node.js, Express 4, JWT auth (`bcryptjs` + `jsonwebtoken`),
`express-rate-limit` on credential routes, `cors`, `morgan`.

**Data** — in-memory store with JSON file persistence
(`server/src/config/db.js`). No external database, so the prototype runs
anywhere. Swapping in MongoDB means replacing that one module.

**AI** — a deterministic, rule-based symptom triage engine
(`server/src/services/aiService.js`). No external LLM key needed; it maps
symptoms → urgency, suggested departments, and ranked doctors.

## Design notes & known limitations

Prototype-scope trade-offs, deliberately made to keep the project runnable with
zero external dependencies:

- **JSON file datastore** — fine for a demo, not for concurrent writes. The
  `db.js` module is the single seam to swap in a real database.
- **Slot availability is simulated** — a generator seeds slots ahead of the
  current date rather than integrating a real calendar.
- **AI triage is rule-based**, not a trained model. It scores symptom keywords
  against specialties; it does not diagnose.
- **Notifications are stored and displayed in-app** — no email/SMS delivery.
- **Auth limiter is skipped when `NODE_ENV !== "production"`** so the smoke
  suite can be re-run freely. Production traffic stays rate-limited.

Accessibility, keyboard-navigable modals, empty/loading/error states, and
responsive layouts are handled in the client; the design tokens in
`styles/index.css` centralise colour and spacing.
